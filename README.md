# Tools used
You can use a personal laptop to follow the course.
In this case it is necessary to install the **Anaconda Navigator** suite on your laptop (downloadable from the website https://anaconda.org/anaconda/anaconda-navigator). 

Those who do not have a personal laptop can use the laptops in the computer lab. The environment used is **Google Colab** which can be used with a browser (Chrome for example) from any PC, directly from the address https://colab.research.google.com/

To access Colab you need to have a **Google account** (those who don't have one can create one from the site https://www.google.com/intl/it/account/about/). Once you have created the Google user, log in to check access to the environment.

**REMEMBER** to bring with you to the computer lab **UID and PWD to access Google and GitHub**.

# Course Description:

This course will introduce students to the Python programming language, with a focus on its applications in economics. Students will learn the basics of Python programming, including data types, variables, functions, and control flow statements. They will also learn how to use Python to perform data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling.

# Course Objectives:
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Write and understand simple Python programs
- Use Python to perform data analysis and visualization
- Use Python to build and fit basic statistical models
- Apply Python to solve simple economic problems

# Course Outline:
- Introduction to Python programming
- Data types and variables
- Functions and control flow statements
- Data Science libraries
- Data analysis and visualization with Python
- Statistical modeling with Python
- Simple Economic applications of Python

# Teaching Methods:
The course will be taught using the notebook Jupyter and the Google Colab Environments. Students will have the opportunity to "learn by coding" and practice Python programming skills through a variety of activities, such as solving coding problems and writing Python programs.

# Assessment:
Students will be assessed on their understanding of Python programming concepts and their ability to apply Python to solve simple problems.

# Prerequisites:
Students should have a basic understanding of mathematics and statistics before taking this course. No prior programming experience is required.

# Target Audience:
This course is designed for students who are interested in learning how to use Python for economic applications. The course is suitable for students of all levels of programming experience, from beginners to advanced.
   
# Educational material and useful links
The course covers multiple topics relating to different scientific disciplines such as Mathematics, Statistics, Data Science, Computer Science and therefore there is no single textbook that contains all the topics.
